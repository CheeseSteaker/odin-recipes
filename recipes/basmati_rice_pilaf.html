        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups basmati rice</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onions</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cummin</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 1/4 cups water</li>
                <li>1 1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/3 cup dried fruit, such as currants, raisins or 
                    finely chopped dried apricots</li>
                <li>1/4 cup sliced or slivered almonds, toasted in a 
                    small dry skillet over medium heat until golden, 
                    about 5 minutes</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the rice in a medium bowl and add enough water to cover by 2 inches.</li>
                <li>Using your hands, gently swish the grains to release any excess starch.</li>
                <li>Carefully pour off the water, leaving the rice in the bowl.</li>
                <li>Repeat four to five times, until the water runs almost clear.</li>
                <li>Using a fine mesh strainer, drain the water from rice.</li>
                <li>Melt the butter in a pot over medium-low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring 
                    regularly, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, 
                    until fragrant, about 30 seconds longer.</li>
                <li>Add the rice to the pot, and cook, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the water, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, 
                    and simmer until all the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
                <li>Off the heat, remove the lid and sprinkle the dried fruit over the rice (do not mix in). </li>
                <li>Place the lid over the pot and let stand for 10 minutes. Toss in the toasted almonds, 
                    fluff the rice with a fork, and serve.</li>
            </ol>
