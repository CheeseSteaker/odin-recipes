    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A wonderful dish full of flavor that is sure to make its enjory to ask for a second bowl.
            This dish can either be eaten by it self, as just two serving of this rice can fill you, 
            or as a diner, or can compliment another main entre as it pairs well with a chicken or beef.
